Before you begin
---

This repository contains 4 problems, each with two levels- basic and advanced. There are corresponding branches for the levels of difficulty.

The README.md file in each problem directory explains the problem in full detail for both levels. You will also find a gradle build file- build.gradle. This is what you will use to import the problems into your IDE, if you use one.

Follow these steps to get through the problems:

1. Fork this repository into your own GitHub profile
2. Clone your forked repository using the command `git clone <your-fork-url>`
3. Look at each of the problems by going through the README.md files
4. When you are confident about the level you want to go for, checkout to that level using ` git checkout <level> `
5. You will find that the problems are pre-configured with:
    1. A *Main class*
    2. Supporting classes as explained in the problems
    3. A test case to check your answer
6. Fill the `Main()` constructor method with you answer
7. Once done, or if you want to try another problem, commit your changes with:
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "<Write a simple message explaining if you are done, or are going to try another problem>"`
    3. `git push`
    4. *Only then start working on another problem*
8. To test your answer, run the testcase named *testAnswer* in TestAnswer test class
9. If you would like to switch the difficulty level, make sure you that you have committed all changes if any by following step 7 again. Then:
    1. `git checkout <level>`
    2. Continue working and committing changes working down from step 6 again.

I will do a live briefing of these steps during the test, but you may use this as a cheatsheet for git commands.

Don't worry if you cannot solve the advanced problems. Those are actually going to be your targets as you learn during the first weeks of internship.

Good luck!
